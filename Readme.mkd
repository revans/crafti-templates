# Crafti Templates - Sample Templates

Right now, this has a sample sinatra template for generating a new sinatra application, the
way I might set one up. If you don't like it, feel free to fork it, change it, and keep it
to yourself to use however you want. I won't accept incoming pull requests, unless you spot
an error or typo. Any preferences should remain as your own, to share how you want to share,
if at all.

Feel free to use, take, steal, rip-off. I don't care.
